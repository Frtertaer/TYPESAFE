# Apps powered by Jev

[All projects](../README.md) · [Tools and integrations](../tools/README.md) · [Share your app](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md#list-a-jev-powered-app)

Discover applications that use Jev to power a real user workflow. Each app has its own full page explaining what it does, how to access it, and where Jev fits. Hosted products and source-built apps are both welcome; other models may power additional features.

Read the [tag guide](../../APP_TAGS.md): **Open source** describes source licensing; **Commercial** marks a paid offering. Both can apply to the same app. Closed-source products are welcome with public Jev evidence and a clear source-review disclosure. Pricing unknowns stay visible.

### Jev Social

`Open source` · `Free source build` · `BYOK`

## Before you get started

Each guide records supported platforms, setup, accounts and keys, data recipients, costs, limitations, and the version reviewed. Follow its launch or build path. Source availability does not imply a downloadable release or free inference, and an app listing does not certify production readiness.

For components to integrate into your own project, browse [tools and integrations](../tools/README.md). For a small offline introduction, try the repository's [teaching examples](../../../examples/README.md).

## List your app

Self-submissions are welcome, including open-source, closed-source, free, and paid apps. Provide a working product or source-build link, official pricing/access information, evidence of Jev use, and your affiliation. Apply the [source/pricing tags and disclosures](../../APP_TAGS.md). Closed-source listings must identify what could not be independently inspected; commercial listings must visibly identify paid access.

Follow [List a Jev-powered app](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md#list-a-jev-powered-app) and the [project-page template](../../PROJECT_TEMPLATE.md), or [open an app suggestion](https://github.com/AppitStudio/awesome-jev/issues/new?template=resource.yml). App pages live in this folder, one full page per app.
