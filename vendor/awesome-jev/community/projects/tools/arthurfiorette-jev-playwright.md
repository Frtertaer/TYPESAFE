Playwright reporter/plugin: TypeSafe Jev selects which E2E tests to run from changed files; skipped tests stay visible and a green run can still mean zero tests executed.

## When to use

Use to **shrink Playwright suites in CI** by letting Jev pick tests related to the diff—distinct from other `jev-playwright` owners.

## How it works

Reporter inspects included changes, asks Jev which tests to run, and skips the rest. Docs warn that selecting zero tests can still exit successfully.

## Get started

```sh
git clone https://github.com/arthurfiorette/jev-playwright.git
cd jev-playwright
git checkout 96bdcc6bdf2dd0a9194c302e84eb6c87abb4f398
# Wire the reporter into playwright.config per README; set TYPESAFE_API_KEY
```

## Examples and demos

- README notes on CI `enabled` gating and “Selected 0/N tests” pitfalls.

## Limits and data handling

Diff/test metadata go to TypeSafe. Do not treat an empty selection as a full-suite pass without comparing to full runs.
