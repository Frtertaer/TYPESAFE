# Tools and integrations

[All projects](../README.md) · [Apps powered by Jev](../apps/README.md) · [Share a tool](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md#add-a-community-project)

Developer tools, libraries, SDKs, integrations, and reference implementations for building with Jev. Each full guide explains how to use the project, what needs adapting, and what was checked. For an application with its own user-facing workflow, visit the separate [app directory](../apps/README.md).

## Try a smaller example

The repository also maintains its own [teaching examples](../../../examples/README.md), [Support Router](../../../projects/support-router/README.md), and [routing evaluation runner](../../../evaluations/README.md). These are useful when you want a small offline starting point before adopting a community project.

## Share or improve a tool

Follow [Add a community project](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md#add-a-community-project) and the [project-page template](../../PROJECT_TEMPLATE.md). Put the full guide in this folder, list it once in a category above, and keep its upstream and guide links in the root README. Corrections to setup instructions and limitations are welcome.

Upstream maintainers own their code and licenses. Check each page's reviewed version and [validation scope](../../../docs/validation.md#community-project-checks); a listing does not establish production quality or endorsement.
