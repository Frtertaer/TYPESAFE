# Awesome Jev [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> Discover Jev-powered apps, developer resources, and runnable decision examples.

[Jev](https://docs.typesafe.ai/introduction) is TypeSafe AI's System One model: give it state and typed questions, then use the returned choices, scores, and probabilities in your code. This independent community directory collects applications that use Jev, resources for developers, and small, inspectable workflows to learn from.

## Explore Jev with our skill

Use **Awesome Jev Guide** to understand Jev and explore solutions that fit your needs. Describe your workflow in plain language, and your coding agent will help you choose an example, adapt a project, or build a suitable starter—with guided setup along the way.

**1. Install the skill.** With Node.js 22+ installed, run this in your project directory:

```sh
npx skills add AppitStudio/awesome-jev --skill awesome-jev-guide
```

Select your coding agent when prompted. For Codex, you can add `--agent codex`. No TypeSafe account or API key is needed to explore ideas or run the offline examples.

**2. Open your coding agent in that project and try a prompt.**

New to Jev? Start here:

```text
Use awesome-jev-guide. Explain Jev simply, help me understand what I can
build with it, and walk me through the easiest example. I don't have
an API key yet.
```

Have a workflow in mind? Fill in the brackets:

```text
Use awesome-jev-guide. Today I [describe the work I do manually].
I want to [describe the result]. I use [language, framework, or tools].
Help me find the best starting point in this repo and explain what
needs adapting. Ask me anything essential that's missing.
```

Ready to build?

```text
Use awesome-jev-guide to build a small starter for [my workflow] using
[my stack]. Start with a working offline demo, explain what I should
customize, then guide me through API-key setup and a first live check
when I'm ready.
```

**3. Follow the next step together.** The guide uses current TypeSafe documentation and explains what already works, what needs building, and how to handle uncertain results. When you want live access, it walks you through private key setup—never paste a key into chat.

See the [full onboarding guide](docs/using-the-guide.md) for installation options, demos, and setup details.

## Start here

**[Explore what you can build](docs/explore-use-cases.md)** — choose a real implementation by the result you want, then follow its guide, worked example, and setup path.

- [Introduction](https://docs.typesafe.ai/introduction) - Understand Jev's state-and-questions interface and its three decision primitives.
- [Official quick start](https://docs.typesafe.ai/introduction/quickstart) - Make a first request using Python or HTTP.
- [Run an example locally](docs/getting-started.md) - Try a complete workflow with synthetic mock responses, without an account, an API key, or package installation.
- [Choose a decision pattern](docs/decision-patterns.md) - Match a task to Choice, Score, or Noul and define what happens when the result is uncertain.
- [HTTP API reference](https://docs.typesafe.ai/api) - Check the wire format, authentication, answer fields, and error responses.

## Official SDKs and tools

These resources are maintained by TypeSafe.

- [Agent skill](https://docs.typesafe.ai/agent-skill) - Give a coding agent the official API context and guidance for designing narrow decision questions.
- [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/typesafe-ai/typesafe-sdk-js) - JavaScript and TypeScript client that infers answer types from the supplied questions.
- [Python SDK](https://github.com/typesafe-ai/typesafe-sdk-python) - Synchronous and asynchronous clients with typed answers and configurable retries.
- [System One Adapter](https://github.com/typesafe-ai/system-one-adapter-python) - Run a similar typed-question interface against other LLM providers for comparisons; those responses do not come from Jev.

## Community projects

**[Browse the project directory](community/projects/README.md)** for separate app and tool directories, each with full project pages covering use cases, setup, examples, limitations, and review evidence. The links below still take you directly to the upstream projects.

Checks are tied to reviewed versions; see each page and the [validation scope](docs/validation.md#community-project-checks). Mocked tests and reported live smoke checks do not establish model quality on your workload.

### Apps powered by Jev

Applications with a user-facing workflow powered in part or entirely by Jev. The [full app directory](community/projects/apps/README.md) shows platforms, access requirements, and Jev's specific role. [Tags](community/APP_TAGS.md) distinguish source access from pricing; commercial and closed-source apps can qualify.

## Computer and browser use

**[Explore computer-use solutions](docs/computer-use.md)** for browser navigation, form filling, data extraction, macOS/Android control, and iOS Simulator experiments. The guide compares inspected implementations, explains their testing boundaries, and develops a practical observe → choose → act → verify design.

Start with [Jev Browser (tontoko)](community/projects/tools/jev-browser-tontoko.md) for Playwright forms, extraction, and app tests, or [Jev Ultrafast](community/projects/tools/jev-ultrafast.md) to study a compact browser loop. Native macOS and Android have separate implementations; the iOS Jev + AXe work is documented as a public demonstration with an unverified release path.

Try the [offline computer-use example](examples/computer-use/README.md) to see field selection, exact source extraction, freshness checks, and independent assertions without controlling a real device:

```sh
python3 examples/computer-use/run.py
```

## Starter projects

Original examples maintained in this repository. Each includes readable questions, application policy, synthetic responses, tests, and an optional live mode. **Mock results demonstrate code behavior, not Jev accuracy.**

- [Computer-use decision cycle](examples/computer-use/README.md) - Select a form field and source value, then check a simulated action with independent assertions; uses its own runner.
- [Quality rubric](examples/quality-rubric/README.md) - Evaluate independent dimensions and combine scores with visible weights in code.
- [RAG triage](examples/rag-triage/README.md) - Check a retrieved passage for relevance, evidence, and contradictory information before selecting context.
- [Span selection](examples/span-selection/README.md) - Extract candidate values in code, select one with Jev, and return the exact source value.
- [Support routing](examples/support-routing/README.md) - Select a department and assess explicit urgency, with review paths for uncertain answers.

With Python 3.10 or newer, from a checkout:

```bash
python3 examples/run.py support-routing --mock
```

See the [example guide](examples/README.md) for all commands and live-mode setup. The examples print decisions; they do not execute downstream actions.

## Reference project

Start with the runnable tool, then evaluate its policy on your own cases.

- [Support Router](projects/support-router/README.md) - Route a batch of tickets with configurable departments and review thresholds, inspect each typed answer, and export a human-review queue.
- [Evaluation runner](evaluations/README.md) - Assess routing and abstention on your own labeled development and holdout cases, with bounded live calls and offline replay.

Both tools are maintained here. Start with the synthetic demo; see [validation scope](docs/validation.md) for what has been checked.

## Patterns and cookbooks

Selected official guides, organized by what you want to build. Cookbook results and benchmarks are the authors' reports, not independent measurements by this repository.

### Routing and classification
